# Save your progress effortlessly

The Drafts feature is here to ensure you never lose your progress when creating new issues. If you're interrupted or accidentally click away, Plane automatically saves your work so you can pick up right where you left off. This improves efficiency and reduces frustration, letting you manage incomplete issues without needing to publish or abandon them.

## How drafts work

:::info
Drafts remain private and won't be visible to team members until you move them to project issues.
:::

We've all been there—clicking outside a modal or navigating away from a page, only to lose all our progress. With Plane, you don’t have to worry about that anymore. As soon as you start working on an issue, Plane auto-saves it for you. If you're interrupted or need to step away, your work is safe in the **Drafts** section on the sidebar. From there, you can easily edit, delete, or move the draft to a project when you're ready.

Want to create a draft manually? Just click **Draft an issue** at the top right, and you can save your draft for later.

Additionally, if you try to discard an issue, you’ll see a confirmation modal offering the option to save it to drafts instead of deleting it, so no progress is lost.

## Manage drafts
To manage your drafts, click the ellipsis (•••) icon next to any draft for several options:

- **Edit**  
Select **Edit** to make changes to your draft as you would with a regular issue. Once you're done, just save your updates.

- **Make a copy**  
Need a duplicate? Simply select **Make a copy** to clone your draft.

- **Move to project**  
Ready to finalize your draft? Click **Move to project** to publish it as a regular issue. Assignees and team members will be notified only once the draft is moved to the project.

- **Delete**  
Created a draft you no longer need? Deleting it is easy. Click **Delete**, confirm, and it’s gone. A toast message will appear confirming the deletion.
    :::caution
    Keep in mind, deleted drafts cannot be recovered. You'll always see a confirmation modal to prevent accidental deletions.

## Troubleshooting
Here are a few common scenarios you might encounter:

- **Draft does not appear after auto-save**  
Refresh your page or ensure you have a stable internet connection. If issues persist, try clearing your browser’s cache.
- **Unable to move a draft issue to an active project cycle**   
Double-check that all the required fields are filled out and that the draft is properly assigned to a project cycle before moving it.
