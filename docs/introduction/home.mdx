## What is Plane
Plane is a versatile project management software designed to simplify the way teams plan, track, and manage their work. Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, Plane offers powerful features such as issue and module tracking, sprint management, time tracking, knowledge management, robust analytics, and more. These tools enable teams to streamline their operations, maintain clarity, and ensure alignment at every stage of the project life cycle. 

Whether you're a startup, a growing business, or an enterprise, Plane adapts to the needs of teams across all industries, making it the ideal solution for efficient, collaborative project management.

## Why Plane
Plane offers an ideal balance between simplicity, adaptability, and powerful features.

- **Flexible and adaptable** <br/>
Unlike other popular alternatives that often enforce specific methodologies or rigid structures, Plane adapts to your teamâ€™s unique workflow preferences without hitting any roadblocks. It evolves with your processes, not against them. Whether you follow Agile, Scrum, or a hybrid methodology, Plane molds to how your team already operates.  

- **Intuitive and easy to use** <br/>
Plane offers an incredibly simple and intuitive interface with a zero learning curve, setting it apart from tools that require costly certifications, or professionals to get started. Whether you're a startup founder or an experienced project manager, Plane is as easy to use as a smartphone, making it accessible to all skill levels.

- **Cloud and self-hosted options** <br/>
While many tools primarily offer cloud-based solutions, Plane provides both cloud and self-hosted options. For companies in highly regulated industries where data security and control are paramount, Plane's ability to be self-hosted within your infrastructure is a major advantage.

- **A force multiplier** <br/>
Plane combines both project management and knowledge management into one platform. While many companies rely on separate tools for documentation and project tracking, Plane merges these functionalities to avoid silos and centralize information in one place.
