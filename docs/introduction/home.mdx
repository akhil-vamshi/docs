This page gives you a quick rundown of Plane and highlights why it's a great choice for managing your projects.

## What is Plane
Plane is a flexible project management tool that helps teams plan, track, and manage their work more efficiently. It’s built to grow with you, offering features like issue tracking, sprint management, time tracking, knowledge management, analytics and more. These tools help your team stay organized, keep things clear, and stay aligned throughout the project.

Whether you're a startup, a growing business, or a large enterprise, Plane can adapt to your team’s specific needs, making it a perfect solution for smooth, collaborative project management.

## Why Plane
Plane offers an ideal balance between simplicity, adaptability, and powerful features.

- **Flexible and adaptable** <br/>
Unlike other tools that try to lock you into a specific way of working, Plane adjusts to your team’s unique workflow. It evolves with your processes, not against them. Whether you follow Agile, Scrum, or a hybrid methodology, Plane molds to how your team already operates.  

- **Intuitive and easy to use** <br/>
Plane offers an incredibly simple and intuitive interface with a zero learning curve. There’s no need for costly certifications or hiring a professional to get started. It’s as easy as using a smartphone, so anyone from a startup founder to an experienced project manager can pick it up and run with it.

- **Cloud and self-hosted options** <br/>
While many tools primarily offer cloud-based solutions, Plane provides both cloud and self-hosted options. If you work in a highly regulated industry where security and data control matter, being able to run Plane on your own infrastructure is a huge benefit.

- **A force multiplier** <br/>
Plane combines project management and knowledge management into one platform. Instead of using separate tools for documentation and project tracking, Plane brings everything together, cutting down on silos and keeping everything centralized.
