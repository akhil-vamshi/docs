This section helps you get comfortable with Plane and find your way around more effectively.

### Onboarding and Invitation

If you have signed up for the first time, the first step in Plane is to create a new workspace.

-  If you are part of a team, you can invite your team members to the workspace before you can begin.
    
-  If you are using Plane for personal use, you can skip the invitation part and be directly redirected to the workspace.

:::tip
During the onboarding process, the invited users will be assigned a **Viewer** role by default. You can adjust the permissions of invited users for your project in the workspace or project settings page based on your specific. 
:::

### The Dashboard

After signing up or signing in to a workspace, you will be redirected to the Dashboard. This is where you will see all of the issues that are assigned and pending for you.

### Creating Workspaces

Think of each workspace on Plane as a home for your content. Ideally, you can consider a workspace as a different company or organization you work with.

-  Inside the workspace, you can create projects as an individual, or invite collaborators to share a workspace as a team - it's up to you!

:::tip
When you sign up for the first time, we'll prompt you to create a new workspace. If you're invited to join, you can directly join the workspace without creating a new one.
:::

### Creating Projects

Projects let you manage teams and issues within your Workspace. After creating your Workspace, you will need to create a new project.

-  If you want to invite other members to a project, you'll need to first add them to a workspace and give them access directly under Project settings after they have been invited.
    
-  You can manage members either by navigating to **Project > Member Settings** page or by **Workspace > Member Settings** page.
    

### Creating Issues

In Plane, an issue is a task or piece of work. It could be small, like _Update the primary color to blue_, or large, like _Building GitHub integration on plane_. It all depends on how you and your team decide to break down your work into issues.

Issues are identified by a project-specific and unique number (Example, `VIH-19`), and they must be provided with a title and a state. All the other properties and relations are optional, know more about them [here](/introduction/quickstart).

:::tip
You can create issues by clicking on the `New Issue` button in the right-hand corner of your project, or by using `C` shortcut.
:::

There's a lot more about Issues, learn about them [here](/core-concepts/issues).

### Creating Cycles

A cycle is a group of issues with a custom time period in which a team works to complete items assigned to them. Cycles are similar to sprints in the agile world. 

:::tip
Only one Cycle can be ongoing at a time to follow the principles of AGILE. However, you can have your upcoming issues or draft issues already created for the next cycles.
:::

-  You can move existing issues to a new or existing cycle, or create a new issue directly inside the Cycle
    
-  Bulk operations are supported--you can add or update multiple issues to cycles at once.
    
-  You can't update issues after a cycle is completed, however, the pending issues can be transferred to a new or upcoming cycle.
    

### Creating Modules

Modules are a flexible way to organise issues in your project. They allow you to break down your work into manageable chunks and track progress towards specific goals or objectives.

-  You can create as many modules as you need within your workspace, and customize each one with its own set of issues, milestones, and team members.
    
-  Modules allow you to add documents and links within them, providing a convenient way to share resources with others within the module.

### Creating Pages

You can think of Pages as an AI-powered notepad. You can use Pages to quickly jot down issues when you're in a meeting or starting a day. Later, you can directly push them to the respective projects to convert them into an issue.
